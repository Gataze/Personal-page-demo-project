#### Static Portfolio Website

## About project

This is my second one page, static website project written in ReactJS and the first with styled-components. It was created for young graphic designer. 

## Tech stack

- ReactJS was used to build the page structure.
- Styled components were used to style the website. Props and attributes were used in Styled componenets to display dynamic changes of style and element location.
- Stylelint and stylelint-order were used to enforce conventions in styles.
